‚úÖ Abstract Class in C# (Simple Explanation)
An abstract class is like a partially finished blueprint. It can have:

Implemented methods (fully written logic),

Abstract methods (no logic; just declared),

Fields and properties,

Constructors.

You cannot create objects of an abstract class directly. Instead, other classes inherit it and must override its abstract methods.

üëâ Example:
csharp
Copy
Edit
using System;

abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void MakeSound(); // Abstract method (no body)
    
    public void Sleep() // Regular method with body
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.MakeSound(); // Output: Bark
        d.Sleep();     // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}
‚úÖ Interface in C# (Simple Explanation)
An interface is like a contract ‚Äî it defines what a class should do, but not how.

It only contains method declarations, no implementation (until C# 8.0 ‚Äî default methods can be added, but still no fields or constructors).

A class that implements an interface must provide the full implementation for all its methods.

üëâ Example:
csharp
Copy
Edit
using System;

interface IVehicle
{
    void Drive();
}

class Car : IVehicle
{
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car is driving");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.Drive(); // Output: Car is driving
    }
}
üîç Abstract Class vs Interface in C#
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Purpose	Partial implementation + structure	Only structure, no implementation (till C# 8)
Method Implementation	Can have both abstract and non-abstract methods	Only method declarations (before C# 8)
Inheritance	Can inherit only one abstract class (single inheritance)	Can implement multiple interfaces (multiple inheritance)
Constructor/Fields	Can have fields and constructors	Cannot have fields or constructors
